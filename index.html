            <h2>BRAINSTORMING</h2>
            <p>This is our brainstorming idea! We used Mind Map to help with our brainstorming</p>
            <img src="IMAGES/White Doodle Handwritten Mind Map Brainstorm.png" href="#">
            <p>Problem:  Sitio Bebe is far from a natural waterway so the local government often imports clean water for the residents, or opens wells. Because of this, there is often a drought in the area especially in summer. The area is experiencing a shortage of health professionals, so residents rarely have anyone close to them whenever someone gets sick.
                <br>
                <br>
                Objectives: Donate money to help mitigate/solve the current crisis in Sitio Bebe
                <br>
                <br>             
                Strategy: Since we are an event organizer we could start a concert so that we could earn enough money not just to earn but to also help SItio Bebe. We could use YouTube and Create a Webpage to be able to advertise our concert. Our first chosen genre is gaming so that our videos can be noticed by people who are interested in gaming. And also create a website to help with the advertising.
                <br>
                <br>
                Revision: We think our plan might fail since there are already many gaming YouTubers that would make our videos not be noticed at all. We changed our genre to an Animated awareness video so that we could not just advertise our concert but still let the viewers know why we were promoting the concert. Also, most people enjoy watching animated videos.
                <br>
                <br>
                Solution: We will make a concert and use our knowledge of creating YouTube videos, animations, and websites to help advertise and gain viewers for someone tp purchase our tickets for the concert.
                </p>
            <h2>CHECK OUT OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR MORE STUFF</h2>
            <p>Our youtube content mostly focuses on Animation. But not just any animation but Awareness Animations!
                <br>
                We decided to make it animated as we found out most people like/enjoy animations.
                <br>

                <h2>Youtube Content</h2>
                <p> We decided to choose Animated Awareness Videos, because we discovered that viewers prefer animation over videos, and this preference increases if the movies contain difficult information and facts. And also because animated videos are more interesting than other forms of videos. This is primarily due to the fact that watching a corporate video is made exciting and enjoyable by animation. Animation also improves audience focus and engagement with the core topic. (ImpressVideo, 2018)
